# Deep Steganography using Steganogan
Image Steganography using GAN is a project that involves hiding secret information within an image using a technique called steganography. The project uses Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs), which are advanced machine learning models, to encode the secret information into the image in a way that is not easily detectable. The goal is to create a system that can securely transmit sensitive data by embedding it within images, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to notice or access the hidden information.
